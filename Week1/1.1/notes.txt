***** Things to keep in mind *****

=> focus on fundamentals
=> Cut out the noice (Layoffs/chatgpt)
=> Stick through it for january
=> Stopping is the only Sin 
=> Dont fear everyone has their own journey
=> Motivation comes and goes but discpline is important
=> Teah runs in cycle (position yourself for the next bull)
=> Content is there , context is missing 


**** Fundamentals ****

-> we need some kind of programming language for web (javascript)
-> ECMAscript standardise javascript gave outline to create compiler or say javascript engin for every browser
-> every browser has written diff kind of code to convert javascript into binary 

=> NODEJS

more backend langs are C++  , JAVA , JAvacsript , Golang , Rust

=>function 
--> functions can take other function as well

=>javascript core theory
